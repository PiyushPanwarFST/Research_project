Abstract
This article aims to estimate the parameters and stress-strength reliability R = P(Y < X) based on the generalized progressive
hybrid censored data when X and Y follow independent xgamma distributions with different scale parameters. The maximum
likelihood estimators and asymptotic confidence intervals for parameters and stress-strength reliability R have been obtained
based on both classical and Bayesian setups. The Bayes estimators for the model parameters and stress-strength reliability R
are derived under the assumption of independent gamma prior using symmetric and asymmetric loss functions. The Markov
chain Monte Carlo technique is employed for Bayesian computations due to the complexity of the posterior, which lacks a
closed-form expression for Bayesian estimators. We have also computed the highest probability density credible intervals
for the Bayes estimators. Additionally, a simulation study is conducted to study the effectiveness of Bayes and maximum
likelihood estimators using mean squared errors. In the end, a real data set has been utilized for illustrative purposes.

1 Introduction
In the discipline of engineering science, stress-strength reliability models are frequently used to design and analyse the reliability of systems. According to reliability theory, stress-strength
reliability is a gauge of how well a system performs under stress
(load). Stress can include electrical voltage, temperatures, pressure, and other atmospheric variables that impact how a system
functions and may even lead to a system failure (see Church and
Harris 1970). In a nutshell, if the system’s accumulated stress
is greater than its capacity, the system will fail and vice versa.
The groundbreaking work of Birnbaum and McCarty (1958)
introduced the topic of stress-strength reliability estimation in
reliability theory. In the monograph by Kotz et al. (2003) various
stress-strength models are thoroughly discussed. Stress-strength

reliability (SSR) of a system may be comprehended in a probabilistic approach since stress and strength variables are random
and cannot be anticipated, as a result, it is calculated using
parametric frameworks for strength and stress variables. The
probability R = P(Y < X) is used to calculate the SSR in parametric inference, where Y and X stand for the stress and strength
random variables, respectively. Owen et al. (1964) were the first
to examine P(Y < X) using a parametric setup under the consideration that X and Y were normally distributed random variables.
Following that, numerous writers investigated the estimation of
P(Y < X) while assuming different lifetime models in a variety
of contexts, including complete and censored samples, bivariate
samples, record values, etc. Using entire sample observation
estimation of P(Y < X) has been done by several authors by
considering different distributions. For example, in exponential distribution by Chung (1982), the estimate and confidence
interval of R in the case of generalized exponential distribution
by Kundu and Gupta (2005) and Hajebi et al. (2012), respectively, inference on stress-strength reliability of two-parameter
exponential distribution by Krishnamoorthy et al. (2007), estimation of P(Y < X) for the three-parameter generalized exponential distribution by Raqab et al. (2008), Weibull by Kundu
and Gupta (2006), inference on stress-strength reliability for

the estimation of P(Y < X) have been conducted with bivariate,
censored, and record data, for detailed information the reader
may see (Pak et al. 2014; Hor and Seal 2017; Hanagal 1997;
Asgharzadeh et al. 2017; Nadar and Kızılaslan 2014; Baklizi
2008) etc.
In real-life scenarios, we are unable to obtain complete
information on the event of interest due to several reasons. As
a result, we must conduct a study using censored data. Therefore, several authors have studied stress-strength reliability under
censored cases. For further detailed information, the reader may
follow, Saraçoğlu et al. (2012), who have addressed how to estimate SSR using a progressive Type-II censoring scheme where

stress and strength follow an independent exponential distribution, Asgharzadeh et al. (2011) focused on the estimation of
SSR based on progressively censored samples. They considered a scenario where X and Y are two independent Weibull
distributions with different scale parameters but the same shape
parameter. The SSR estimate for the Weibull distribution, generalized Pareto distribution, proportional hazard models, and
inverse Weibull distribution were each examined by Valiollahi et al. (2013), Rezaei et al. (2015), Basirat et al. (2015),
and Yadav et al. (2018) using progressive Type-II censored
samples, respectively. Mirjalili et al. (2016) discussed SSR of
exponential distribution based on Type-I progressive hybrid censored samples. Alslman and Helu (2022) and Asadi and Panahi
(2022) have considered inverse Weibull distribution and inverted
exponentiated Rayleigh distribution under adaptive Type-II progressive hybrid censoring for the estimation of stress-strength
reliability, respectively. Saini et al. (2021) and Krishna et al.
(2019) have studied the estimation of stress-strength reliability
for generalized Maxwell failure distribution and inverse Weibull
distribution under progressive first failure censoring. Recently,
Çetinkaya (2023) have studied inference of P (Y < X) for the
Burr-XII model under generalized progressive hybrid censored
data with binomial removals. To the best of our knowledge, neither the classical paradigm nor the Bayesian paradigm has been
taken into account to estimate the SSR for the xgamma distribution. Hence, the considered work using xgamma distribution
under the generalized progressive hybrid censoring scheme has
been proposed to fill up the gap.

In the literature, xgamma distribution was first introduced
by Sen et al. (2016) using a finite mixture of exponential and
gamma distributions. The following equations provide the
cumulative density function, probability density function,
and hazard function of the considered model;

respectively, where 𝜃 is a scale parameter.
The applicability of the xgamma distribution in reliability
theory has been extensively addressed by several authors, viz.
Elshahhat and Elemary (2021) have discussed the problem of
analysis for xgamma parameters under Type-II adaptive progressively hybrid censored data. Pathak et al. (2024) examined
E-Bayesian inference for the xgamma distribution under progressive Type-II censoring with binomial removals. Saha and
Yadav (2021) have considered the problem of estimation of the
reliability characteristics by using classical and Bayesian methods of estimation for xgamma distribution. Using Type-II hybrid
censored data, Yadav et al. (2019) discuss Bayesian estimation
of the parameter and the reliability properties of the xgamma
distribution. Recently, Yadav (2022) has considered an asymmetric loss function for Bayesian estimation of the xgamma
distribution under Type-I hybrid censored data, etc.
Censoring is a typical element of life-testing experiments
that might occur spontaneously or as a result of confinement.
Experimenters prefer censored observations to make accurate
deductions about the traits of any lifetime model in clinical
trial investigations. Type-I and Type-II censoring schemes are
the most often utilized censoring scheme out of all censoring
schemes. In Type-I censoring strategy, the experiment stops at
a specified time T, but when using a Type-II censoring scheme,
the experiment is ended when a certain amount of failures m
realized. However, neither of these two schemes permits the
removal of experimental units while the experiment is still running. Therefore, Progressive censoring is suggested in the literature to overcome the demerits of Type-I and Type-II censoring scheme by Cohen (1963). In the problem of life testing and
reliability assessment, using the mentioned censoring scheme,
there may not be adequate failure data, or even worse still, there
may be no failure at all, or the items may take a long time to
fail. Hence, these circumstances could significantly impact

the efficacy of inferential analysis. To overcome this problem
Epstein (1954) introduced a hybrid censoring approach based
on the combination of Type-I and Type-II censoring schemes.
In the similar scenario of life testing experiments, the TypeI progressive hybrid censoring scheme (Type-I PHCS) has
been investigated by Kundu and Joarder (2006) and Childs
et al. (2008). In which, n identical units are tested with the progressive censoring scheme (R1 , R2 , ⋯ ⋯ Rm ), where Ri is the
number of removals at ith failure and the experiment ends at
time T ⋆ = min{Xm∶m∶n , T}, where T ∈ (0, ∞) and 1 ≤ m ≤ n
are predefined and the resulting ordered failure are obtained as
X1∶m∶n ≤ X2∶m∶n ≤ ⋯ ⋯ ≤ Xm∶m∶n. The test can never exceed
T, which is a benefit of this censoring strategy. Thus, this
plan has control over the experiment’s duration and expense.
There can be fewer than m failures, though, if the unknown
average lifetime is significantly higher than the termination
time T. This progressively diminishes the effectiveness of the
conclusions drawn from such censored data, keeping this in
mind, Childs et al. (2008) suggested the Type-II progressive
hybrid censoring technique, which ends the experiment at a
time T ⋆ = max{Xm∶m∶n , T} and guarantees at least m failures
to achieve a desired level of efficiency with prefixed removal
(R1 , R2 , ⋯ ⋯ Rm ) at each failures. When Xm∶m∶n > T , signifying the experiment’s termination at the mth failure, it is
important to note that the duration of the termination period
may considerably extend. However, failures are observed
up to time T when Xm∶m∶n < T . If D is the number of failures that happen before time T, then the progressive removal
scheme in this situation is (R1 , R2 , ⋯ Rm , Rm+1 , ⋯ RD ), where
Rm = Rm+1 = ⋯ = RD = 0. As a result, we can observe that
the experimenter is unaware of the experiment’s stopping time
under such a technique. The Type-I hybrid censoring technique
preserves the experiment’s termination time below a certain
value by sacrificing efficiency, while the Type-II hybrid censoring scheme assures efficiency beyond the predetermined level
while forfeiting the experiment’s termination time. As a result,
there is a necessity for a censoring scheme that can control termination time and efficiency at the same time. For instance,
it must ensure the lowest possible amount of failures, and set
constraints on time as well. Therefore, the generalized progressive hybrid (GPH) censoring approach has been proposed by
Cho et al. (2015), which overcomes the disadvantages of both
Type-I PHC and Type-II PHC. The purpose of this work is to
propose a point and interval estimate of the SSR parameter of
the xgamma distribution using generalized progressive hybrid
censored samples under both classical and Bayesian setups.
The following sections serve as the structure for the remaining portions of the paper. Section 2 provides an extensive overview of the considered censoring mechanism. The formulation
of R and its maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) are obtained
in Section 3. We have calculated 95% asymptotic confidence
intervals (ACIs) based on ML estimates using asymptotic

Life Cycle Reliability and Safety Engineering

normality criteria of MLE and bootstrap confidence intervals
have been also obtained using bootstrap samples, respectively.
In Section 4, we obtained Bayes estimators under squared error
and LINEX loss functions. These estimations utilize the Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique, considering independent gamma distributions as prior information with hyper parameters a1, b1 and a2, b2. A simulation study is conducted to assess
the performance of ML and Bayes estimators in section 5. In
Section 6, the demonstration of the practical applicability of the
study has been given by analyzing a real-world data set. The
study concludes with a summary of the findings presented in
Section 7.

2 The GPHC scheme
Let us consider a life-testing study where n identical components are placed to the test. Let X1 , X2 , ⋯ , Xn be the independent and identical units from the distribution with probability
density (pdf) f(x) and cumulative distribution function (cdf)
F(x), which are provided in equations (2) and (1), respectively.
To establish the generalized progressive hybrid censoring
scheme, we consider fixed number of failures k and m with
k < m, belonging to the positive integers. The units are eliminated randomly by a pre-decided removal scheme as the R1
units are removed randomly at the time of the first failure. At
the moment of the second failure from the surviving units, R2
units of the remaining items are removed, and so on Ri units
are eliminated randomly at ith failure, meeting the constraints
∑m
R + m = n. This process is continued until the termination
i=1 i
time T ⋆ = max{Xk∶m∶n , min{Xm∶m∶n , T}} is reached. At this
point, all of the remaining units are withdrawn from the experiment with pre-fixed time, where T ∈ (0, ∞). The fact that this
technique guarantees at least k failures rather than witnessing m
failures should be emphasized. D should represent all failures up
to time T. As a result, three situations occur under this scheme,
resulting in the following set of observations
Case-I:X1∶m∶n , ⋯ , X2∶m∶n , ⋯ , Xk∶m∶n ,

if T < Xk∶m∶n < Xm∶m∶n ,

Case-II:X1∶m∶n , ⋯ , Xk∶m∶n , ⋯ , XD∶m∶n ,

if Xk∶m∶n < T < Xm∶m∶n ,

Case-III:X1∶m∶n , ⋯ , Xk∶m∶n , ⋯ , Xm∶m∶n ,

if Xk∶m∶n < Xm∶m∶n < T.

3 Stress‑strength reliability and maximum
likelihood estimation
Let X and Y be the independent strength and stress random
variables follows xgamma distribution with parameters 𝜃1
and 𝜃2 respectively. Then, the expression of stress-strength
reliability is obtained as
∞

R = P[Y < X] =
if T < Xk∶m∶n < Xm∶m∶n ,
if Xk∶m∶n < T < Xm∶m∶n ,
if Xk∶m∶n < Xm∶m∶n < T.

after performing some algebraic calculations, the expression
for the SSR parameter R is given by
R
=

(7)

𝜃22 ((𝜃1 + 1)𝜃24 + (4𝜃12 + 6𝜃1 + 1)𝜃23 + (6𝜃13 + 12𝜃12 + 5𝜃1 )𝜃22 + (4𝜃14 + 10𝜃13 + 10𝜃12 )𝜃2 + 𝜃15 + 3𝜃14 )
(𝜃1 + 1)(𝜃2 + 1)(𝜃1 + 𝜃2 )5

From the above equation (7), it is clear that that SSR (R) is
function of parameters 𝜃1 and 𝜃2 , respectively. Therefore, to
compute the MLE of R under the GPH censoring scheme,
first, we have to derive the MLE of the parameters 𝜃1 and
𝜃2 and then by using the invariance property, MLE of R is
computed. Therefore, by using equations (1), (2) and (6)
the combined likelihood for the considered model under the
GPH censoring scheme can be written as

such as nlm() is used to obtain the MLE (𝜃̂1 , 𝜃̂2 ) for (𝜃1 , 𝜃2 ).
Once the MLE of the parameters are obtained then by using
the invariance property of MLE, the MLE of SSR parameter

exact distribution of R is mathematically intractable. Hence,
the concept of the delta method is applied to obtain the
asymptotic variance of R. This method allows us to approximate the variance of a function of random variables using
the first-order Taylor expansion. This approach yields the
following asymptotic variance of R, say V is

3.2 Bootstrap confidence intervals
In this section, an alternative approach for constructing
confidence intervals, as proposed by Efron (1982) has been
considered. Efron introduced a computer-based technique
that offers a practical and accessible method for computing
confidence intervals without requiring extensive theoretical
deliberation. The Computational algorithm for implementing the bootstrap method is provided below:
Algorithm:
1. Generate random GPH samples X = {x1 , x2 , ...., xn1 } and
Y = {y1 , y2 , ...., yn2 } of size n1 and n2 , respectively from
xgamma(𝜃1) and xgamma(𝜃2) and compute the MLEs of
𝜃1 and 𝜃2.

then, the 100(1 − 𝛼)% boot-t confidence interval
of 𝜃 is given by

(𝜃̂ − ̂t⋆(𝛼∕2) se(𝜃̂ ⋆ ), 𝜃̂ + ̂t⋆(𝛼∕2) se(𝜃̂ ⋆ ))
by following the procedure outlined above we
can compute the boot-p and boot-t confidence
interval for 𝜃1, 𝜃2 , and R.

4 Bayesian estimation
The Bayesian estimators for the unknown parameters of
the xgamma distribution and the stress-strength reliability
parameter R are presented in this section. Bayesian estimation requires the specification of a prior distribution for

the unknown parameter. The choice of prior distribution
depends on the available information about the parameter.
In cases of limited or no information available, it is advisable to use a non-informative prior. On the other hand, an
informative prior can be used if sufficient information is
available. The gamma distribution is commonly chosen as
an informative prior for the parameter in Bayesian estimation due to its flexibility, richness, and computational simplicity (see Yadav 2022; Singh et al. 2015). Therefore, in
this study, we assume independent gamma priors for the
unknown scale parameters 𝜃1 and 𝜃2 with hyper-parameters
(a1 , b1 ) and (a2 , b2 ), respectively.
𝜃

a −1 − 1

𝜋1 (𝜃1 ;a1 , b1 ) ∝ 𝜃1 1 e b1 ,

𝜃1 > 0, a1 > 0, b1 > 0

and
𝜃

a −1 − 2

𝜋2 (𝜃2 ;a2 , b2 ) ∝ 𝜃2 2 e b2 ,

𝜃2 > 0, a2 > 0, b2 > 0

The hyperparameters associated with prior distributions can
be easily computed when the prior mean and variance are
specified. For instance, if an experimenter possesses prior
knowledge regarding the expected value M𝜃1 of the parameter 𝜃1, along with an associated variance V𝜃1 reflecting the
degree of confidence in this prior belief, the parameters of
the prior distribution can be determined accordingly. Specifically, assuming a Gamma prior, we can express M𝜃1 = a1 b1
V𝜃

and V𝜃1 = a1 b21, which leads to the expressions b1 = M 1 and
𝜃1

M𝜃2

a1 = V . An analogous approach can be employed for deter1

𝜃1

mining the prior parameters of 𝜃2 . It is important to emphasize that, in scenarios where prior knowledge about the
parameters is limited or unavailable, it is advisable to set the
prior variance to a sufficiently large value (approaching
infinity), thereby yielding a non-informative or diffuse prior
distribution that minimizes the influence of prior assumptions on the posterior inference.
The joint prior for the parameters (𝛼, 𝛽) is written as
𝜃

a −1 − 1

𝜃

𝜋(𝜃1 , 𝜃2 ) ∝ 𝜃1 1 e b1 𝜃2 2 e b2

of (𝜃1 , 𝜃2 ) for the given GPH data is given by

In Bayesian inference, the selection of the best estimator
from a posterior distribution involves the use of a loss function. Here, both symmetric and asymmetric loss functions
have been considered. The symmetric loss function, such
as the squared error loss function (SELF), is commonly
employed in Bayesian statistics. This loss function assigns
equal importance to both overestimation and underestimation. On the other hand, the asymmetric loss function, such
as the LINEX loss function (LLF), is helpful when overestimation or underestimation is more detrimental than the

LLLF (𝜁, 𝜁̂ ) = ec(𝜁 −𝜁) − c(𝜁̂ − 𝜁) − 1;

c ≠ 0,

(19)

respectively. Where c is the loss parameter and if value of
c in (19) is negative (c < 0), underestimation is considered
more serious than overestimation. Conversely, when c is
positive (c > 0), overestimation is considered more serious
than underestimation. It is important to mention that when c
in equation (19) approaches zero, the LLF behaves similarly
to the SELF.
Under the squared error loss function and LINEX loss
function, the Bayes estimators of any general parametric
function Φ(𝜃1 , 𝜃2 ) are defined as follows:

respectively. In equations (20) and (21), it is important to
replace the general function Φ(𝜃1 , 𝜃2 ) with 𝜃1, 𝜃2 and R to
obtain the desired Bayes estimates of parameters. However,
evaluating the integrals in (20) and (21) explicitly is not feasible. Therefore, any Bayes approximation technique might
be used to obtain the Bayes estimates. One commonly used
approach for computing approximate Bayes estimates is
the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. Several
authors have employed MCMC techniques, for the same viz.
Oramulu et al. (2023), Kumar et al. (2023), Hassan et al.
(2024). Here, the same technique has been implemented to
obtain the Bayes solution, the detail of the MCMC technique
is given in the following subsection.

4.1 Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods
This section emphasises the use of Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) methods, which aim to generate samples
from complex distributions or posterior distributions of

(21)

Carlo" reflects the nature of the process, as it involves
iteratively sampling new random values from the posterior distribution based on the previous value. A Markov
chain, which is a series of values taken from the posterior
distribution, is produced by this iterative process. The
Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm and the Gibbs sampler are the two most widely used MCMC techniques. See
Hastings (1970) for further information on the MetropolisHastings (MH) method, which generates samples from any
given probability distribution function. This approach has
several advantages over other sampling like inversion and
accept-reject sampling, including the ability to work successfully with multivariate distributions and the lack of
the necessity for an envelop function and a normalising
constant in rejection sampling.
By employing the Metropolis-Hastings (M-H) algorithm, we can compute the Bayes estimates and determine
the corresponding highest posterior density (HPD) credible intervals for the unknown parameters 𝜃1 and 𝜃2 of the
xgamma distribution, using generalised progressive hybrid
censored (GPHC) sample. The conditional posterior densities of 𝜃1 and 𝜃2 can be formulated in the following manner.

5 Simulation study
In this section, the performance of the proposed estimators
are studied using a Monte Carlo simulation study. To generate the GPH censored samples from xgamma distribution,
we have considered different values of censoring parameters
n1, n2 , m1 , m2 , k1 and k2 , with model parameters 𝜃1 = 0.5, 1,
𝜃2 = 1 and time thresholds T1 = 0.5, 0.75 and T2 = 0.5, 0.75.
The simulation results are obtained through 10,000 replications. Based on the mean square error (MSE) and the average width of the confidence intervals, the performance of
the point and interval estimates are examined. The Coverage probabilities are also determined to assess the confidence level of the intervals for the considered censoring
scheme. Following are the three censoring schemes have
been considered.
• Scheme I: R1 = ni − mi , R2 = ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ = Rm = 0.
i
• Scheme II: R1 = ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ = Rm −1 = 0, Rm = ni − mi.

R1 = ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ = Rni −mi = 1, Rni −mi +1 = ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ = Rmi = 0.i = 1, 2.

Under considered loss function, we use non-informative
prior (NIP) and informative prior (IP) distributions to calculate the Bayes estimates. For the LLF, we have examined
three different values of c, namely −1.5, 0.05, and 1.5. In
the case of IP, the hyperparameters are determined using a
specific formula, while in the case of NIP, they are assumed
to be approximately zero.
The MLEs of the parameters along with the interval
estimates, for the aforementioned considered variation of
the censoring schemes have been computed. boot-p and
boot-t confidence intervals are also calculated for the the
same variation of censoring parameters. Furthermore, the
Bayes estimates of the parameters using informative and

non-informative priors under SELF and LLF are computed
based on MCMC samples. The HPD credible interval is also
computed using the considered variation of the censoring
scheme, following the idea of Chen and Shao (1999) algorithm. The point and interval estimates of the parameters 𝜃1,
𝜃2 , and R, as presented in Tables 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, lead to
the following conclusions.
C1. ML and Bayes estimates of parameters and SRR
parameter (R) are quite good, as reflected by the average estimates converging towards the actual values
when we increase the effective sample size ( m1, m2 ,
k1, k2) for fixed (n1, n2, T1, T2). Moreover, the estimates
also converge to actual values as n1 and n2 increases.
C2. Indeed, with a rise in effective sample sizes ( m1, m2 ,
k1, k2 ) while maintaining ( n1, n2 , T1, T2 ) as fixed, it
is as anticipated that the mean square errors (MSEs)
decrease for both ML and Bayesian estimations. Additionally, as n1 and n2 increase, the MSEs also exhibit a
declining trend.
C3. ML estimates are quite close to that of Bayes estimates,
particularly when non-informative priors are used
under SELF. However, when we incorporate informative priors under SELF, the Bayes estimates exhibit
superiority over ML estimates in terms of the average
estimate, MSE, and the length of Confidence Intervals
(CI).
C4. Increasing the effective sample sizes ( m2 , m2 , k1, k2 )
while keeping the values of (n1, n2, T1, T2) fixed led to a
reduction in the average width of the 95% ACIs, bootstrap, and Bayes credible intervals. Notably, the average width of ACIs and HPD credible intervals, based

on non-informative priors demonstrate a remarkable
closeness. However, among all the methods considered, HPD credible intervals relying on informative
priors exhibited the shortest width.
C5. Among boot-p, boot-t, and ACI, we observe that boot-t
perform more effectively than boot-p for the parameters 𝜃1 and 𝜃2 , and ACIs demonstrate the best performance in terms of average width. Additionally, when
considering SSR, boot-p and boot-t show approximately identical average lengths and are smaller than
the length of ACIs. When we consider informative
priors, the HPD demonstrates superior performance,
achieving a shorter average width among all considered methods.

6 Real data application
To provide an illustrative insight, this section deals with real
lifetime data, which represent the duration of waiting times
(measured in minutes) for customer service in two distinct
banks reported by Ghitany et al. (2008). Here, we are interested in estimating the stress-strength parameter R, where
X and Y denote the customer service time in Bank A and B,
respectively.
To commence our investigation, we initially conducted
the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test to assess the fitting of
the xgamma distribution to the datasets. The results obtained
by the K-S test are outlined in Table 9. The K-S test statistic
and p-values indicate that the xgamma distribution fits the
data well. Hence, we can use the xgamma distribution to
model these data sets. Proceeding to the subsequent phase,
we assume that X and Y denote the durations of waiting
times, measured in minutes, before customer service in two
different banks identified as A and B, respectively. To analyze the provided real data, we have considered the following
schemes under the GPH censoring schemes.

The point and interval estimates obtained using classical
and Bayesian approaches are presented in Tables 10 and
11, respectively. Additionally, the boot-p and boot-t interval estimates are reported in Table 12. We observed that
Bayes estimates are quite close to the ML estimates based
on the results reported in the tables. However, in case of
interval estimates, it is noteworthy that the width of the
Bayesian credible intervals is consistently smaller than the
ACI across all three considered censoring schemes. The
estimate of SSR indicates that the customer at bank A has
higher chance to wait before customer service than at bank
B. In the case of interval estimation based on real data, we
get similar results as we have obtained in the simulation
study for all considered methods. Further, the trace and
posterior density plots for the considered real data set and
specified schemes are given in Figure 2, 3, and 4 to show
the fine mixing of the chain based on the MCMC samples.

This article explores point and interval estimation for
model parameters and stress-strength reliability parameters (R) of the xgamma distribution under a generalized
progressive hybrid censoring scheme in classical and
Bayesian frameworks. For the Bayesian estimation, independent gamma distribution is considered as a prior distribution. The explicit solution of ML and Bayes estimates is
not achievable, so we have used the Newton–Raphson iterative procedure in the classical approach and the MCMC
technique in the Bayesian approach. We have also obtained
95% boot-p and boot-t confidence intervals. Based on the
results obtained, we concluded that Bayes estimates are
quite close to the ML estimates when we use non-informative priors under SELF and are better than ML when we
use informative priors. For the interval estimation, we also
observed that among all the considered methods ACIs,
boot-p, and boot-t, boot-t perform more effectively than
boot-p for the parameters 𝜃1 and 𝜃2 , and ACIs outperform

both based on their interval width. Furthermore, for stressstrength reliability, both boot-p and boot-t offered similar
average lengths, which are shorter than ACIs. Among all
the considered methods of interval estimation HPD credible interval performed best when we considered informative priors.
