Estimation of Stress-Strength Reliability of Xgamma
Exponential Distribution with Generalized Progressive
Hybrid Censoring
Abhimanyu Singh Yadav, Piyush Panwar
Abstract
This article focuses on the estimation of the stress-strength reliability parameter
R = P (Y < X), where both the stress Y and strength X are assumed to follow a
newly proposed extension of the one-parameter Xgamma distribution. The model’s
structural and distributional properties are studied, and inference is carried out under
generalized progressive hybrid censoring, which provides a unified framework encompassing both time and failure-based censoring mechanisms. Parameter estimation is
performed under both classical and Bayesian approaches. In the classical setup, only
the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method is considered. To quantify uncertainty, asymptotic confidence intervals for R are constructed using both the Fisher
information and nonparametric bootstrap methods. In the Bayesian framework, the
estimation is conducted using a gamma prior under the squared error loss function.
The Bayes estimates are computed via Lindley’s approximation and Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. Credible intervals for the stress-strength reliability
parameter are also obtained, and their coverage probabilities are evaluated. A Monte
Carlo simulation study is carried out to compare the performance of the MLE and
Bayesian estimates under various censoring scenarios in terms of bias, mean squared
error, and coverage probability. The effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed model
and estimation methods are demonstrated through two real data examples.

In recent years, the estimation of stress-strength reliability R = P (Y < X), which quantifies the probability that a system’s strength exceeds the applied stress, has garnered significant attention in reliability and life-testing studies. While various classical and Bayesian
approaches have been employed for this purpose under different lifetime distributions, most
existing works focus on standard censoring schemes such as Type-I, Type-II, or progressive
censoring. However, in practical applications, censoring often arises in more complex forms,
and generalized progressive hybrid censoring has emerged as a more realistic and flexible
alternative by accommodating both time and failure constraints. Additionally, although
the Xgamma distribution exhibits flexible hazard shapes and has potential applicability in
reliability modeling, its role in stress-strength analysis under complex censoring schemes remains largely unexplored. To address these gaps, this article proposes a new extension of the
one-parameter Xgamma distribution and investigates the estimation of the stress-strength
reliability parameter under generalized progressive hybrid censored data. The unknown
parameters are estimated using the classical maximum likelihood method and Bayesian approaches with a gamma prior under the squared error loss function. The Bayesian estimates
are obtained via Lindley’s approximation and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. Confidence intervals are constructed using asymptotic theory and nonparametric
bootstrap techniques, while Bayesian credible intervals are also developed and evaluated. A
comparative Monte Carlo simulation study is conducted to assess the performance of classical
and Bayesian estimators in terms of bias, mean squared error, and coverage probability. Furthermore, a modified goodness-of-fit test based on the Nikulin–Rao–Robson (NRR) statistic
is introduced to evaluate the fit of the proposed model under both complete and censored
data. The proposed methods are illustrated through two real-life data sets involving complete
and right-censored observations.
The remainder of this article is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the proposed
distribution and its properties; Section 3 describes the generalized progressive hybrid censoring scheme; Section 4 presents classical estimation and interval procedures; Section 5
discusses Bayesian estimation techniques; Section 6 reports the results of simulation studies;
Section 7 presents the goodness-of-fit test; Section 8 applies the methodology to real data;
and Section 9 concludes with key findings and suggestions for future work.

Stress-strength reliability

In mechanical engineering, stress-strength reliability is very frequently used to measure the
performances of the equipment in use. Let X and Y denote the strength-stress RVs observed
from the population Xg-E(λ1 ) and Xg-E(λ2 ), respectively. Then the probability P [Y < X]
is called as stress-strength reliability parameter. It is denoted by R. The same is evaluated
for the proposed model and is given by;

R = Pr[Y < X] =
f (x, λ1 ) f (y, λ2 )dx dy
x=0 y=0

f (x, λ1 ) F (x, λ2 )dx,

using the PDF and CDF of the proposed model, R is calculated as;
